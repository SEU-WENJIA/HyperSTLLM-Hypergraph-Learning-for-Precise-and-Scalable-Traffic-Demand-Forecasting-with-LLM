## HyperSTLLM: Leveraging Hypergraph Learning for Precise and Scalable Traffic Demand Forecasting with Large Language Models

Welcome to HyperSTLLM's GitHub repository! This project aims to explore the application of hypergraph spatio-temporal learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) in traffic flow demand forecasting. By combining these two advanced techniques, we have developed a novel prediction framework capable of capturing the complex dynamics of transportation networks more precisely and enabling efficient processing of large-scale data.
